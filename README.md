# EmailSchedular
The email schedular is a gsheets and script combo which allows you to create calendar events for a code workshop scenario. I have this case where there is a team which organizes regular code workshops and 3 members are selected to chair the event. One of them is a moderator and the remaining are reviewers. The model can be used for any such code logic.

### Things to do
* Use a template for the invite message
* Move the constants to a configuration file or to the sheet (preferably)
* Logic to understand how much data is there on sheet
* Code should be able to handle corrupt data states
* Generic enough to handle other models
